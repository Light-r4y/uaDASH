The primary way to flash the display module is to simply run the upload.bat file in Windows.

*** MAKE SURE TO UNPLUG 12v power while updating firmware via USB ***

** There are at least two additional upload options.

Option one: see https://github.com/rusefi/dash5_esp32s3/?tab=readme-ov-file#flash-for-use-esp-web-flasher

Option two: use the Arduino IDE.

On WAVESHARE_S3_LCD7 use USB labeled UART1!
